```
She is betraying us! Russia alone must save Europe.
 Our gracious sovereign recognizes his high vocation
 and will be true to it. That is the one thing I have
 faith in! Our good and wonderful sovereign has to
 perform the noblest role on earth, and he is so virtuous
 and noble that God will not forsake him. He will fulfill
 his vocation and crush the hydra of revolution, which
 has become more terrible than ever in the person of this
 murderer and villain!
